# FlowGen

FlowGen is a scalable, AI-powered learning orchestration platform that converts a user’s intent into a structured, multi-module learning experience.  
It is designed with an asynchronous, priority-driven architecture to handle expensive AI workloads efficiently while maintaining a responsive user experience.

---

## Problem Overview

Generating high-quality educational content using large language models is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Traditional synchronous systems struggle under load, leading to poor user experience, high latency, and increased operational costs.

FlowGen addresses this challenge by decoupling user requests from AI computation using background job queues and priority-based execution. This ensures that the system remains responsive, cost-efficient, and horizontally scalable.

## Key Features

- Prompt-based course generation
- Structured course outlines with modules and lessons
- Lazy lesson generation to minimize unnecessary AI usage
- Priority-based lesson generation for active users
- Asynchronous processing using Redis-backed queues
- Fault-tolerant background workers
- Persistent storage of courses and lessons
- Secure authentication using Auth0
- Scalable backend architecture suitable for production workloads

## High-Level Architecture

FlowGen follows an event-driven, asynchronous architecture:

1. Users submit a topic prompt via the frontend.
2. The backend immediately enqueues a course outline generation job.
3. Course outlines are generated asynchronously and stored in the database.
4. Lessons are scheduled for background generation with low priority.
5. When a user opens a specific lesson, it is promoted to high priority.
6. Workers process jobs independently and persist results.
7. The frontend polls or fetches lesson status until content is ready.

This design ensures that user-facing APIs are never blocked by AI computation.

## System Design Principles

### Asynchronous First

All AI-related workloads are handled outside the request-response lifecycle. User requests enqueue jobs and return immediately.

### Priority-Based Execution

User-triggered lesson requests are always prioritized over background generation tasks, ensuring minimal wait time for active users.

### Horizontal Scalability

The system scales by adding more workers. No changes are required to API logic or data models.

### Cost Optimization

Lessons are generated only when needed. If a lesson is never opened, it may never be generated, reducing AI token usage.

### Fault Isolation

Failures in AI services or workers do not affect user-facing APIs. Jobs are retried or marked failed safely.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React
- React Router
- Auth0 React SDK

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- BullMQ (Redis-based job queues)
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Auth0 JWT verification

### Infrastructure
- Redis (Upstash)
- MongoDB Atlas
- Vercel (Frontend)
- Render (Backend)

---

## Queue Architecture

### COURSE_QUEUE
- Handles course outline generation
- Triggered when a user submits a topic
- Asynchronous and non-blocking

### LESSON_QUEUE
- Handles lesson generation
- Supports priority-based execution
- High priority for user-clicked lessons
- Low priority for background lazy generation

Jobs are deduplicated using deterministic job IDs to prevent duplicate lesson generation.

## Data Model Overview

### Course
- Title
- Description
- Creator (Auth0 user ID)
- Modules
- Metadata and timestamps

### Module
- Title
- Course reference
- Ordered lessons

### Lesson
- Title
- Content blocks
- Generation status (PENDING, GENERATING, GENERATED)
- Parent module reference

---

## Failure Handling and Reliability

- Worker crashes do not lose jobs; Redis persists job state.
- Failed jobs can be retried automatically.
- AI API failures are isolated to workers.
- The system degrades gracefully instead of failing globally.
- Idempotent lesson generation prevents data corruption.

---

## Scalability Considerations

- Redis queues absorb traffic spikes.
- Workers can be scaled independently.
- Priority-based scheduling protects user experience.
- The architecture supports future extensions such as:
  - Rate limiting
  - Multi-tenant queues
  - Tier-based prioritization
  - Distributed worker clusters

---

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Upstash Redis instance
- Auth0 application

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:password@host:6379
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://your-auth0-domain/
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-identifier
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Running the Backend

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running the Frontend

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why FlowGen Is Scalable

- User traffic is decoupled from AI computation
- Heavy workloads are handled asynchronously
- Priority queues protect active users
- Horizontal scaling is straightforward
- Cost grows linearly with actual usage, not traffic spikes
